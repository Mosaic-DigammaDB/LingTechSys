## Preview 

This repository contains neither executable code nor 
data.  To see the latest developments for CR2 
(the Cross-Disciplinary Repository for Covid-19 Research) 
please refer to the Mosaic-DigammaDB/CRCR repository.

The purpose of this repository is to illustrate the 
structure of data sets generated with 
"Dataset Creator" and to outline several tools, 
developed by Linguistic Technology Systems, 
which are used in the curation of CR2.

Programmers or organizations who would like to 
use these tools for their own projects 
are invited to contact us for more information.

**DigammaDB**
DigammaDB is a C++ Hypergraph Database Engine.   This 
engine is designed to employ a similar interface as 
found in existing graph/hypergraph databases or libraries, 
such as HyperGraphDB, WhiteDB, and HgLib (so that code and 
coding techniques applicable to these projects can be 
adapted for DigammaDB).  In the implemention used for 
CR2, DigammaDB employs WhiteDB for the raw data storage.

An important feature of DigammaDB is the Hypergraph 
Exchange Format (HGXF), which is used to serialize 
the information contained in DigammaDB databases.  
HGXF can also be employed as a general-purpose serialization 
format, especially for scientific data.
